# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

2 and 3 will match the path. 4 would match beacuse it takes you to a different page after the path being called.

Yes that is correct. But so will path 2. Why? And why not path 4?
