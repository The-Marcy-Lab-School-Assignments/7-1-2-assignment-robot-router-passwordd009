# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

using a single-page app will be a lot faster and better at fecthing data becuase theres no time being made rendering or swithcing pages. While the benefits of MPA's are that it provides a way to organize data, components, and content. Overall, SPA are for a more sinplistic application and MPA are more for large scaled applications.
